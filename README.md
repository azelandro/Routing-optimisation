# Routing-optimisation

The use of the internet has seen an increase in demand over the years. This technology has been a backbone of the human society, from health to it being integral in the foundation of their businesses, economies, nations, industries and so on. With the internet being integral to humans, we can rarely stay without it, even on flights that previously didn't have the capacity before 2004. But with the distance of aircrafts to the necessary facilities, it is necessary the limited resources are used properly to satisfy passengers. This notebook talks about how those resources can be optimized using algorithms, where the Dijkstra and the Bellman-Ford are used in solving a single objective problem of end to end transmission rate.
